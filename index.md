### JSON Path Finder

Are you having problems with finding path to your deeply nested property key from root in a JSON file. Don't worry, we got you covered.
We have the tool which will give you the desired path with just one click in a jiffy. Now you don't have to go all the way up to the root copying each parent key and then it's parent and so on. Just use JSON path finder. I personally use it for our i18n JSON which are very deeply nested, and I always ended up wasting time this path which led me to developing my very first extension for VS Code.

Looks pretty easy doesn't it?
